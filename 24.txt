The 24 game tests one's mental arithmetic.
Write a program that randomly chooses four digits, each from 1 to 9, with repetitions from 1 to 9.
The porgram should prompt for the player to enter an arithmetic expression using just those, and all of
those four digits, used exactly once each.
The porgram should check then evaluate the expression. The goal is to evaluate an expression that comes out to
evaluate to 24.
-only addition, multiplication, and subtraction are allowed
-division should use floating point of rational arithmetic
-brackets are allowed, if using an infix expression operator
-forming multiple digit numbers from the supplied digits is disallowed.
-The order of the digits when given does not have to be preserved.
-The type of expression evaluator is not mandated. An RPN evaluator is equally acceptable for example.
-The task is not for the program to generate the expression, or to test whether an expression is even possible.

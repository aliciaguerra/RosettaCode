You have 100 doors that are initially closed. You make 100 passes by the doors. 
The first time through, you visit every door and toggle the door (if the door is closed you open it;
if it is open, you close it).
The second time you only visit every second door (door #2, #4, #6, etc). The third time 
you only visit every third door (#3, #6, #9) until you only visit the hundredth door.
What state are the doors in after the last pass? Which are open? Which are closed?
